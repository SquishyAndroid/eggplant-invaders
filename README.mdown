### What is this repository for? ###

* Playing around with a Space Invader style game in Phaser.js using. I built in buttons for movement + fire instead of using the keyboard to allow for mobile. 

* As phaser.js needs a server to run, I added Node and Express for an easy way to quickly run the game.
